# FitRecover

FitRecover is a mobile application designed to track CO2 tolerance tests, helping users understand their recovery status after workouts. The app features an interactive interface where users can perform inhale/exhale exercises, with data stored for historical analysis.

## Features

- **Interactive CO2 Tolerance Test**: Users can perform a series of inhalations and exhalations, with visual feedback and instructions.
- **History Tracking**: The app records each test's results, providing a detailed history of exhalation times.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive design with responsive animations.
- **Customizable Metrics**: Users can track their exhalation duration and view their progress over time.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building the mobile app across iOS and Android.
- **Expo**: For rapid development and testing of the React Native app.
- **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety and improve development efficiency.
- **AsyncStorage**: For persisting user data locally on the device.
